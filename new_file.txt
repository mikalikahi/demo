I'm going to write something that is a modification. 
Now I'm writing something prior to downloading something from Github with other changes 
Now I'm adding something to the text to mess around with github forks
I (my alter-ego phil-in-taipei) added a directory and practiced
recursively deleting and restoring the directory.
Then I accepted a pull request from alter-ego me.
In a moment I'm going to commit this change remotely.
Then I'm going to delete the directory and push the changes.
Then alter-ego me will make sure that the fork is up-to-date with this original repo
